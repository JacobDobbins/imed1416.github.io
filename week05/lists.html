<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recomends:</p>

<blockquote>"Make this the night before so that the flavors time to blend. Just bring it up to room temputure before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm"</blockquote>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<li>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</li>
<li>2 large garlic cloves</li>
<li>2/3 c. kalamata olives</li>

</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
